  abstract = {The need to collect accurate and complete pedigree information has
	been a drawback of family-based linkage and association studies.
	Even in case-control studies, investigators should be aware of, and
	condition on, familial relationships. In single nucleotide polymorphism
	(SNP) genome scans, relatedness can be directly inferred from the
	genetic data rather than determined through interviews. Various methods
	of estimating relatedness have previously been implemented, most
	notably in PLINK. We present new fast and accurate algorithms for
	estimating global and local kinship coefficients from dense SNP genotypes.
	These algorithms require only a single pass through the SNP genotype
	data. We also show that these estimates can be used to cluster individuals
	into pedigrees. With these estimates in hand, quantitative trait
	locus linkage analysis proceeds via traditional variance components
	methods without any prior relationship information. We demonstrate
	the success of our algorithms on simulated and real data sets. Our
	procedures make linkage analysis as easy as a typical genomewide
	association study},

  title = {Heritability of pulmonary function estimated from pedigree and whole-genome
	markers},
  journal = {Front Genet},
  year = {2013},
  volume = {4(174)},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are major
	worldwide health problems. Pulmonary function testing is a useful
	diagnostic tool for these diseases, and is known to be influenced
	by genetic and environmental factors. Previous studies have demonstrated
	that a substantial proportion of the variation in pulmonary function
	phenotypes can be explained by familial relationships. The availability
	of whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data enables
	us to further evaluate the extent to which genetic factors account
	for variation in pulmonary function and to compare pedigree- to SNP-based
	estimates of heritability. Here, we employ methods developed in the
	animal breeding field to estimate the heritability of forced expiratory
	volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and the
	ratio of these two measures (FEV1/FVC) among subjects in the Framingham
	Heart Study dataset. We compare heritability estimates based on pedigree-based
	relationships to those based on genome-wide SNPs. We find that, in
	a family-based study, estimates of heritability using SNP data are
	nearly identical to estimates based on pedigree information, and
	range from 0.50 for FEV1 to 0.66 for FEV1/FVC. Therefore, we conclude
	that genetic factors account for a sizable proportion of inter-individual
	differences in pulmonary function, and that estimates of heritability
	based on SNP data are nearly identical to estimates based on pedigree
	data. Finally, our findings suggest a higher heritability for FEV1/FVC
	compared to either FEV1 or FVC},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies are designed to discover SNPs that
	are associated with a complex trait. Employing strict significance
	thresholds when testing individual SNPs avoids false positives at
	the expense of increasing false negatives. Recently, we developed
	a method for quantitative traits that estimates the variation accounted
	for when fitting all SNPs simultaneously. Here we develop this method
	further for case-control studies. We use a linear mixed model for
	analysis of binary traits and transform the estimates to a liability
	scale by adjusting both for scale and for ascertainment of the case
	samples. We show by theory and simulation that the method is unbiased.
	We apply the method to data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control
	Consortium and show that a substantial proportion of variation in
	liability for Crohn disease, bipolar disorder, and type I diabetes
	is tagged by common SNPs},

  abstract = {SNPs discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) account

	the proportion of variance for human height explained by 294,831
	SNPs genotyped on 3,925 unrelated individuals using a linear model
	analysis, and validated the estimation method with simulations based
	on the observed genotype data. We show that 45% of variance can be
	explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously. Thus, most of the
	heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected
	because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance
	tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due
	to incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and
	genotyped SNPs, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor
	allele frequency than the SNPs explored to date},

  abstract = {For most human complex diseases and traits, SNPs identified by genome-wide
	association studies (GWAS) explain only a small fraction of the heritability.
	Here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex
	trait analysis (GCTA), which was developed based on a method we recently
	developed to address the "missing heritability" problem. GCTA estimates
	the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the
	whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association
	of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main
	functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships
	from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the
	SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS
	simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained
	by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of
	dosage compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate
	and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets},
