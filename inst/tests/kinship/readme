Documentation for KIN 27-11-2001 JH Zhao

This distribution includes a driver program and an executable program based on
Morgan v2.0/kinship and Werner pedigree example.  The remaining source code is
available from (http://www.stat.washington.edu/thompson/Genepi/Morgan.shtml).
Note Morgan v2.3 has kin program to handle for more sophisticated pedigree.

A list of files

kindrv.c     Driver
kin.exe      Executable program
readme       This file
werner.pre   A pre-MakePed file
werner.kin   Output

werner.pre is a sample input file in LINKAGE pre-MakePed format.  Basically it
includes family ID plus triple information of individual ID, father ID, and
mother ID.  If you wish to know more about that format, please consult Prof
Jurg Ott's website at http://linkage.rockefeller.edu.

werner.kin was obtained from werner.pre by following command

kin <werner.pre >werner.kin

Note Under Windows system this is only possible under MS-DOS prompt. To
enter this mode, follow the sequence below,

Click Start -> Run, and type command, cd \your_kin_directory

The MS-DOS windows may be too small on WinNT, you can press Alt+Enter to
toggle between high-resolution small window and low-resolution large window.
You can switch between you Windows tasks using Alt+Tab.

If your system has MS-DOS Prompt in the Programs list, you can follow the
sequence below,

Click Start -> Programs -> MS-DOS Prompt, cd \your_kin_directory

Otherwise the program automatically enters interactive mode, asking for
pedigree ID, individual ID, father ID and mother ID.  Like Morgan you will also
need tell the program when your input ends by signalling EOF (end of file),
i.e.  ^Z for MS-DOS and ^D for Unix.

When you finish a MS-DOS session use exit command to give control back to
Windows.
