Version history of R genetic analysis package (R/gap)

Todo list:

. to be compatible with definitions in genetics
. standard error of haplotypes
. phase routine to include hap, genecounting or PHASE
. hap/hap.em to handle missing only one allele and X Chromsome data
. joint genetic and environmental effects and mixed models
. pca regression and htSNP
. linkage analysis programs
. C/Fortran calls to .Call, etc.
. NEXUS format, C++ from GDA site

It benefits from the original author of HWE ("Guo, Sun-Wei" <swguo@mail.mcw.edu>)

Refine 2ld.R and 2ld.c according to the C program 2LD 
Revisit pfm.sim.f (f95 -PIC -xlibmil -xO5 -dalign -c by Brian Ripley).

Version 1.0-2

14-4-2005

Done with genecounting involving Chromosome X data.
Comment on code for hrt which is useless and causes crashes.
Move fine controls of genecounting and hap to gc.control/hap.control.

18-3-2005

Version 0.8-4

add NAMESPACE
change bt, gcontrol, mtdt
add pedtodot
add datasets mao, nep499, snca, cf, fa, crohn

which requires package genetics
change onLoad to .onLoad

Version 0.8-3

8-11-2004

adapt haplo.score fully for hap.score
create examples for hwe.hardy using pgc, etc.
add gcp
modify gc.em, hap.em to allow for any allele labels
change hwe to accept allele, genotype and genotype count more naturally
change digit2 and digitm from int to void because of a complaint by Brian Ripley

Version 0.8-2

16-8-2004

Add keyword as required by R 2.x
Change hwe.hardy.c, pgc.h and makeped.c according to gcc -Wall -pedantic

Version 0.8-1

5-6-2004

add kin.matrix to kin.morgan using algorithm similar to g2a
replace tril/triu in mtdt with standard function lower.tri/upper.tri
add resid and scale prob in genecounting
relabel gret in pgc.Rd as cdata
delete comma in pfc.R and fix problem with loop index in pfc.f
add pfc.sim


Version 0.8

4-2-2004

Crashes by hwe.hardy go away, chi-squared tests to be implemented

8-2-2004

Add hwe, decided any details should go to the R code itself

17-2-2004

Add static to outfile in pgc.h and hap.c, pointed by Jan de Leeuw (deleeuw@stat.ucla.edu)

21-2-2004

Completion of the first comprehensive analysis of data on Parkinson's disease and SNCA markers from
Abbas Parsian (parsian@louisville.edu) (HWE, haplotype frequency estimation, score tests, Fisher's
exact test, hwde, genetics) and gap obtained comparable results with SAS combined with hwe of 
Jurg Ott (ott@rockefeller.edu) but dealing with missing data; this could be released as an example
later on. It was decided that auxiliary functions are better added after the actual linkage analysis
codes are working.

Fix lr statistic in gc.em.R due to rename of lnlx to lx

26-2-2004

Reverse the order of version history in this file (starting from the most recent)

Changes for Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) according to Michael Barmada (michael.barmada@hgen.pitt.edu):
. do_switch --> ndo_switch in hwe.hardy.c
. malloc.h --> malloc/malloc.h in gcontrol.c and makeped.c; but it seems ok to stick to stdlib.h
. add static to n_loci, etc. in hap.c, mia.c to avoid conflict
