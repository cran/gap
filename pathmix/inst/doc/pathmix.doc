    On this diskette, you should find the following files:

PATHMIX.DOC -- this document

PATH3A.EXE  -- estimates familial correlations from the family data

PATH3B.EXE  -- fits path models to the family data

TEST.BAT    -- DOS batch file to run a sample job

TEST.DAT    -- sample nuclear family data (50 families with phenotypes and
               environmental indices for 2 parents and 3 children each)

1.0   overview:

           The programs PATH3A and PATH3B are collectively called
      "PATHMIX method 3".  Together they are used to estimate correlations in
      nuclear families and/or to fit path models to the family data.  They
      will run on an IBM PC or compatible with a hard disk and will require
      approximately 512K of memory.  A math coprocessor, while not absolutely
      required, is highly recommended.  The programs will run up to 20 times
      faster when a math coprocessor is present.

           PATHMIX requires two input files:  a "job file" which contains a
      short list of control specifications for each of the three programs,
      and a data file containing the quantitative family data.  Each program
      writes a summary of its results to a "terse file", and diagnostic
      output to a "prolix file".


1.1   the data file:

           The data file sould contain nuclear family data of the following
      form:

      -- Each record represents an individual.

      -- Records for members of the same nuclear family should be contiguous.

      -- Each record must contain the following fields:

            -- a family identification number;
            -- a position code number in the range 1 to 3, where 1=father,
               2=mother, 3=offspring;
            -- a quantitative measure of the phenotypic trait; and
            -- a quantitative measure of the environmental index

         A record may optionally contain other information (e.g. age, sex,
         other phenotypic measures) which is ignored by PATHMIX, but may
         be used in data transformations.

      example:

           In the data file from the enclosed sample job, the first nuclear
      family is:

        151 01  -0.2710  -0.5329
        151 02   0.4345   0.2091
        151 03  -0.9180  -0.0746
        151 03  -1.3383   0.5475
        151 03  -1.3663  -0.0592

      These 5 records are identified as belonging to the same family by their
      family number (151).  The fact that both parents and three children are
      present is indicated by the position codes 01 (father), 02 (mother),
      and 03 (offspring).  The missing value code for any unknown phenotype
      or index is a blank field.  In the enclosed data file (created by
      simulation for testing) all 50 families have the same family structure
      in order to speed up the execution time of the test problem (all have
      two parents and three offspring).  In practice, the nuclear families
      would not have the same structure and the program would take much
      longer to run.  However, no special coding is needed when the data
      consists of families with different structures.


1.2   the job file:

           Both of programs require "control cards" to specify the operations
      to be performed.  The job file is divided into logical subfiles,
      separated by the control card "<EOF>".  The control cards for the PATH3A
      program appear in the first and second subfiles, those for the PATH3B
      program appear in the first and third subfiles.  The first subfile
      contains information about the input data and is identical for both
      programs.  Note that all alphabetic information in the job file must
      be in upper case.


2.0   Reading the Data
      ----------------

           The first subfile of the job file is used by both PATH3A and
      PATH3B.  The control cards in this subfile specify the position and
      format of the data fields (described in 1.1 above) as they occur
      within each record of the data file.

      The first subfile from the enclosed sample job is:

      CC SAMPLE JOBFILE FOR PATHMIX
      FM (F5.0,F3.0,F9.0,F9.0) ID PO PH IN
      TX IF (PO EQ 4) PO = 3
      TX IN = (IN-.17362) / SQRT(1.15718)
      TX PH = (PH-.04026) / SQRT(1.05745)


           The first control card, the "CC" card is simply a comment.


           The "FM" control card specifies the format of each data record
      using a Fortran format statement.  Use "F" format for data fields.  "X"
      specifiers are used to skip unused columns, and "T" specifiers are used
      to skip to a specific column in the record.

           Following the format portion of the FM card is a list of variable
      names in the order that they are defined in the format portion.  As many
      names should be given as there are format fields.  Four variable names
      are required.  They are:

            ID = family identification number
            PO = position code number
            PH = quantitative measure of phenotype
            IN = quantitative measure of index

      Other variables may be read from the data file as required for data
      transformations.  If the FM card exceeds 80 columns, it may be
      split into as many as three lines.  To indicate that a control card
      is continued on the next line, place a '*' in column 79.


           "TX" control cards specify optional transformations to apply to the
      input data when it is initially read into the program.  Transformations
      take any of three forms:

               1)    TX <variable name> = <expression>

               2)    TX IF ( <condition> ) <variable name> = <expression>

               3)    TX IF ( <condition> ) REJECT

      where <variable name> is the name given in the FM card (or a new
      variable name), <expression> is an algrebraic expression, and
      <condition> is a boolean expression.  The following operators and
      functions are defined:

         operators:              +        addition
                                 -        subtraction or unary minus
                                 *        multiplication
                                 /        division
                                 **       exponentiation

         elementary functions:   LOG x    natural log.
                                 LOG10 x  common log.
                                 EXP x    inverse natural log.
                                 x MOD y  modulus
                                 INT x    truncate to integer
                                 SQRT x   square root
                                 SIN x    sine
                                 COS x    cosine
                                 TAN x    tangent
                                 ASIN x   arc-sine
                                 ACOS x   arc-cosine
                                 ATAN x   arc-tangent

         constants:              PI       3.14159...

         boolean functions:      x EQ y   equal to
                                 x LT y   less than
                                 x GT y   greater than
                                 x LE y   less than or equal to
                                 x GE y   greater than or equal to
                                 x NE y   not equal to
                                 x AND y  logical conjunction
                                 x OR y   logical disjunction
                                 BLANK i  test vbl. i for missing value

      In addition, the function Xi evaluates to the current value of a
      variable, where i is the ordinal number defining a variable in the
      variable table.  (The first variable difined is X1, the second X2 and
      so on.)  Operator precedence is defined in the traditional manner,
      e.g. exponentiation before multiplication, etc., but can be made
      explicit through the use of parentheses.

      In the example above, the following operations are performed:

            1. if the position code (PO) has a value of 4 for any
               record, it is replaced with the value 3;

            2. the index (IN) is standardized by subracting the mean and
               dividing by the standard deviation.

            3. the phenotype (PH) is standardized by subracting the mean
               and dividing by the standard deviation.

      These last two transformations are included to illustrate the use of
      transformations.  In practice, means and variances are model parameters
      which can be fixed at specified values or estimated within the PATH3A or
      PATH3B, so prior standardization is not required.


3.0   PATH3A
      ------

           The second subfile of the job file specifies the correlations
      which are to be estimated by PATH3A from the processed data file.  The
      resultant log-likelihood value can be compared with a log-likelihood
      obtained using PATH3B to assess the overall fit of a particular path
      model.  Normally, one would run PATH3A once and PATH3B several times.

           In PATH3A, three control cards are allowed:  the "CC" card, the
      "PA" card, and the "IT" card.  As in the first subfile, the CC card is
      simply a comment.  The PA card specifies starting values to be used in
      the estimation; and the IT cards lists the paramaters which are to be
      estimated.  PA cards take the form "PA (PAR1=0,PAR2=.12)" where PAR1
      and PAR2 are names of estimable parameters.  If a value is specified
      in the PA card for a parameter not occurring in the subsequent IT card,
      that parameter will be fixed to the specified value and not estimated.
      Similarly, default values are assigned to all parameters which are not
      listed in the PA card.

           The names of the estimable parameters in PATH3A are as follows:

      UPF -- mean of father's phenotype
      UIF -- mean of father's index
      UPM -- mean of mother's phenotype
      UIM -- mean of mother's index
      UPC -- mean of child's phenotype
      UIC -- mean of child's index
      VPF -- variance of father's phenotype
      VIF -- variance of father's index
      VPM -- variance of mother's phenotype
      VIM -- variance of mother's index
      VPC -- variance of child's phenotype
      VIC -- variance of child's index
      R12 -- correlation between father's phenotype and his own index
      R13 -- correlation between father's phenotype and mother's phenotype
      R14 -- correlation between father's phenotype and mother's index
      R15 -- correlation between father's phenotype and child's phenotype
      R16 -- correlation between father's phenotype and child's index
      R23 -- correlation between father's index and mother's phenotype
      R24 -- correlation between father's index and mother's index
      R25 -- correlation between father's index and child's phenotype
      R26 -- correlation between father's index and child's index
      R34 -- correlation between mother's phenotype and her own index
      R35 -- correlation between mother's phenotype and child's phenotype
      R36 -- correlation between mother's phenotype and child's index
      R45 -- correlation between mother's index and child's phenotype
      R46 -- correlation between mother's index and child's index
      R55 -- correlation between child's phenotype and sib's phenotype
      R66 -- correlation between child's index and sib's index
      R56 -- correlation between child's phenotype and sib's index
      R65 -- correlation between child's phenotype and his/her own index

           The default fixed and/or starting values for all estimable
      parameters in PATH3A are as follows:

      -- mean (UPF through UIC) = sample mean
      -- variance (VPF through VIC) = sample variance
      -- correlation (R12 through R65) = sample product-moment correlation

      One can override any of these defaults with an entry in the PA card.

           The IT card takes the form "IT (PAR1,PAR2,PAR3=PAR4)" where PAR1
      through PAR4 are names of estimable parameters.  Each parameter listed
      will be estimated.  Two or more parameters may be "set equal" using
      equal signs, in which case they will be estimated simultaneously, thus
      sharing the same value.

           For convenience, the keyword "ALL" has been defined for use in the
      IT card.  It is used as an abbreviation for the following:

            VPC,VIC,R12=R34,R13,R14=R23,R15,R16,R24,R25,R26,R35,R36,R45,R46,
            R55,R66,R56,R65

      which specifies that the two sib variances should be estimated, as well
      as all correlations, except that the two spouse phenotype-index
      correlations are set equal to one another, and similarly the two
      parent self phenotype-index correlations are set equal to one another.
      The ALL keyword may be accompanied by additional parameters names.
      However, the ALL specification, used alone, is sufficient for most
      PATHMIX applications.

           Both PA cards and IT cards may be continued across several lines.
      (Do not use a '*' in column 79, as in the first subfile.)  Each line
      is limited to 80 columns.

           In addition to specifying the list of iterated parameters, the IT
      card can optionally contain a second set of parentheses to override
      the default values of one or more program variables.  The variables
      which can be controlled in this way include the following:

         H     -- the numerical differentiation interval (default = .0001)
         TOL   -- the value at which the normalized gradient "UKU" is deemed
                  successfully converged (default = .0001)
         IVERB -- verbosity of diagnostic output (5=most verbose, 0=least
                  verbose, default=2)

           In the enclosed sample job, the second subfile of the jobfile is:

      CC ESTIMATION OF CORRELATIONS IN REIMUT'S SIMULATED FAMILY DATA
      PA ()
      IT (ALL)

           This directs the PATH3A program to estimate, by maximum likelihood,
      the values of two variances and 16 correlations.  All six of the means
      are fixed at their default value (the sample means), and all of the
      variances are started at their defaults (the sample variances), two
      being estimated and four being fixed.


4.0   PATH3B
      ------

           The third subfile of the job file specifes the path model(s) to
      be applied to the data.  The control cards function identically to
      those in PATH3A, except that in PATH3B, estimable path coefficients
      replace the correlations.

           The parameters corresponding to path coefficients are described as
      follows:

      H  -- effect of childhood genotype on childhood phenotype (default=0)

      Z  -- multiplied by H to give effect of adulthood genotype on adulthood
            phenotype (default=1)

      C  -- effect of childhood transmissible environment on childhood
            phenotype (default=0)

      Y  -- multiplied by C to give effect of adulthood transmissible
            environment on adulthood phenotype (default=1)

      M  -- correlation between parental adulthood genotypes, through
            social homogamy (default=0)

      U  -- correlation between parental adulthood transmissible
            environments, through social homogamy (default=0)

      P  -- correlation between parental adulthood phenotypes, through
            phenotypic homogamy, treated as a copath (Cloninger,PNAS,1980)
            (default=0)

      RG -- correlation between the childhood and adulthood genotypes of
            an individual, treated as a copath (default=1)

      FF -- effect of father's transmissible environment on that of a
            child he rears, both environments measured at the same time
            (default=0)

      FM -- effect of mother's transmissible environment on that of a
            child she rears, both environments measured at the same time
            (default=0)

      B  -- effect of non-transmitted common sibship environment on the
            environment of a child (default=0)

      X --  multiplied by B to give the effect of non-transmitted common
            sibship environment on the environment of an adult offspring
            (default=1)

      I  -- effect of childhood transmissible environment on child's index
            (default=0)

      V  -- multiplied by I to give the effect of adulthood transmissible
            environment on adult's index (default=1)

      J  -- effect of childhood genotype on child's index (default=0)

      W  -- multiplied by J to give the effect of adulthood genotype on
            adult's index (default=1)

           The names of the estimable means and variances are as in PATH3A:

      UPF -- mean of father's phenotype
      UIF -- mean of father's index
      UPM -- mean of mother's phenotype
      UIM -- mean of mother's index
      UPC -- mean of child's phenotype
      UIC -- mean of child's index
      VPF -- variance of father's phenotype
      VIF -- variance of father's index
      VPM -- variance of mother's phenotype
      VIM -- variance of mother's index
      VPC -- variance of child's phenotype
      VIC -- variance of child's index

           Just as in PATH3A, default fixed and/or starting values for
      the means and variances are the sample values.

         In the enclosed sample job, the third subfile is:

      CC ESTIMATION OF 10 PARAMETERS USING REIMUT'S SIMULATED FAMILY DATA
      PA (H=.5,Z=1.0,C=.5,Y=1.0,I=.5,V=1.0,U=.5,FF=.2,FM=.2,B=.5)
      IT (VPC,VIC,H,Z,C,Y,I,V,U,FF,FM,B) (TOL=.0000001)

           This directs the PATH3B program to estimate, by maximum likelihood,
      the values of the ten path coefficients and two variances listed in the
      IT control card.  The PA card specifies starting values to be used in
      the estimation.  If a value is specified in the PA card for a parameter
      not occurring in the subsequent IT card, the parameter will be fixed to
      that value and not estimated.  Similarly, default values are assigned to
      all parameters which are not listed in the PA card.  In the above
      example, all six of the means are fixed at their default value (the
      sample means), and all of the variances are started at their defaults
      (the sample variances), two being estimated and four being fixed.  Had
      parameter "H" been omitted from the PA card, it would have taken its
      default value of zero.  Multiple sets of CC/PA/IT cards may appear in
      this subfile.


5.0   Running the program under DOS
      -----------------------------

           After preparing the two input files as described above, one is
      ready to run "PATHMIX method 3".  Begin by simply entering either
      "PATH3A" or "PATH3B", whereupon you will be prompted for the names
      of the input and output files.  If an error is detected while reading
      the job file, a message elucidating the problem will appear in the
       terse output file.  Re-edit the job file and try again.

           A note on output files: be aware that if you specify the name of
      an output file which already exists, the old file will be overwritten.
      If a blank line is entered when asked for the name of the prolix file,
      the prolix output will be directed to CON in order to monitor the 
      progress of the optimization procedure within the program as it is 
      executing.  Also note that in addition to disk file names, the two
      DOS device names "CON" and "PRN" are available as output devices.
      CON refers to the PC's screen and PRN refers to the default printer.  


6.0   The sample job:
      ---------------

           A sample job has been included on this diskette.  It includes
      the files beginning with TEST and the files IN3A and IN3B.  The batch
      file TEST.BAT can be used to run both PATH3A and PATH3B successively.

           The test problem writes output to the the printer (device LPT1).
      Since the program writes 132 column output, I set my Epson printer to
      compressed mode by using the DOS command "MODE LPT1:132,8".
