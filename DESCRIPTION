Description: It is designed as an integrated package for genetic data
        analysis of both population and family data. Currently, it
        contains functions for sample size calculations of both
        population-based and family-based designs, probability of
        familial disease aggregation, kinship calculation, statistics
        in linkage analysis, and association analysis involving genetic
        markers including haplotype analysis with or without environmental
        covariates.
